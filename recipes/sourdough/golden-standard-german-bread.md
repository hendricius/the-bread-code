# Golden Standard German Bread

If you come to Germany you need to experience this bread. For ages the Germans have baked bread with sourdough and rye. Traditionally rye has been used because it can already be planted starting September in the year before.

I call this the standard bread because if you ask Germans about their bread, usually it is a variation of this one. Also when travelling the world so far I have not seen other countries where this kind of bread is as popular. Usually I had to go to special bakeries to find something similar.

It has a somewhat greyish color on the inside. That is why it is also called `Grey-bread` in Germany.
