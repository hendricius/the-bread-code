# Sprouted Rye Sourdough

the sprouting process makes the grain’s nutrients more bioavailable to those consuming the grain. When sprouting begins, enzymes within the grain are activated and start to metabolize the starchy endosperm. This transforms long-term storage starch into simple sugars that are more easily digested by the growing plant. Protein compounds within the grain go through the same type of transformation – newly activated enzymes increase the bioavailability of storage proteins by transforming them into peptides and amino acids. These changes – the transformation of starch to simple sugar and the degradation of storage proteins – make the grain easier for humans to digest. This includes gluten, which is a protein found in some grains such as wheat, barley and rye. Because the geminating seeds’ enzymes basically “pre-digest” the gluten, those with non-celiac gluten sensitivities tend to be less reactive to gluten in sprouted grains.

## Custom Ingredients

- 250g rye
- 250g wheat (optional, can use 100% rye)
- 500g water
- 250g rye flour
- 100g sourdough starter
- 14g salt
- 14g brotgewurz (optional)

### Custom Preparation steps

sprout the rye and wheat berries.  on day 1 soak the berries
in water.  day 2, rinse and cover with a cloth.
On day 3 the berries should be sprouting.

combine sprouted rye and wheat in a blender with 500g of water
and blend until smooth.

dump into a bowl and add salt, rye flour, sourdough and brotgewurz
let rise up to 18 hours.

Bake at 180c (350f) for an hour.  after the bread is cooled, placing it into
a plastic bag will provide for a softer crust.
