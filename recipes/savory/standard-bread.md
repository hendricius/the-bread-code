# Standard Bread

The standard white bread has no custom ingredients except flour, water, salt and yeast.
It has an excellent taste, is fluffy and at the same time crispy.
It's an excellent starter for various meals. Serving it with butter or olive oil is recommended and creates an incredible taste experience.
It also combines nicely with dips or alongside the sauce of your main course.
