# Easy Naan

Best Naan- Serve with Shish Kabobs! :)



## Ingredients

-1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
-1 cup warm water
-¼ cup white sugar
-3 tablespoons milk
-1 egg, beaten
-2 teaspoons salt
-4 ½ cups bread flour
-2 teaspoons minced garlic (Optional)
-¼ cup butter, melted

## Directions 

Step 1:
In a large bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Let stand about 10 minutes, until frothy. Stir in sugar, milk, egg, salt, and enough flour to make a soft dough. Knead for 6 to 8 minutes on a lightly floured surface, or until smooth. Place dough in a well oiled bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and set aside to rise. Let it rise 1 hour, until the dough has doubled in volume.

Step 2:
Punch down dough, and knead in garlic. Pinch off small handfuls of dough about the size of a golf ball. Roll into balls, and place on a tray. Cover with a towel, and allow to rise until doubled in size, about 30 minutes.

Step 3: 
During the second rising, preheat grill to high heat.

Step 4:
At grill side, roll one ball of dough out into a thin circle. Lightly oil grill. Place dough on grill, and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, or until puffy and lightly browned. Brush uncooked side with butter, and turn over. Brush cooked side with butter, and cook until browned, another 2 to 4 minutes. Remove from grill, and continue the process until all the naan has been prepared.
