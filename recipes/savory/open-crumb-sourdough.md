# Open Crumb Sourdough

The goal of this recipe is to create fluffy sourdough bread that features an
excellent open crumb. The crumb should have evenly spread alveoli. The crust
of the bread should be thick and crispy, feeling almost like if it was fried.
That way you experience two different consistencies thus creating a more
wholesome taste experience.

Please note that this is by far the most complex bread you can bake. All the
parameters depend on each other. If you commit a small error at one of the steps,
chances are you will not be able to create similar product. It has taken me
approx. 200 attempts and 400 hours to get this recipe right. This is also by
far the most time intensive bread that I have baked in the past. The dough
requires working, you need to carefully observe fermentation. 2 hour per loaf
is a realistic time. It would be interesting to know if similar bread can be
achieved by using more tools, or whether it remains artisan craftsmanship.

Furthermore different temperatures, different flours all result in you require
handling the dough differently. Throughout this guide I will explain all
the pitfalls I encountered with possible fixes. I have always used the same
base recipe, trying to only change 1 parameter at the time. That way I could
improve from bread to bread. I tried to be as scientific as possible, but
sometimes I accidentally changed multiple parameters. Sometimes I would do one
step a few minutes later simply because I had to finish drinking a beer, going
to the toilet. It's very hard to repeat exactly the same process throughout
every bake, but try your best!

Do not feel demotivated if you can not complete the recipe with similar results
right away. Feel free to open up an issue here on the repository to receive
further advice on what you should look at.

## Preparing your starter

The foundation of every bread is a healthy sourdough starter. A small portion
of sourdough is mixed into your bread to start the fermentation process. This
dough is called the starter or levain. I had to learn the importance the hard
way. In fact, I had started to master all the steps, what was missing was
simply a healthy starter. So simple, but I was so much focused on my
technique that it took me a long time to realise that the foundation of my
baking was weak.

The breads I made had great taste, but very visually not appealing.
When working the dough it almost always stuck to my hands. The dough was super
sticky. I was wondering how people could handle such sticky dough? Most
recipes call for something around 75-85% hydration. That's 85 grams of water
per 100 grams of flour. The dough in my case stuck to my hands, kitchen
surface and ultimately the baneton. Loafs with 65 or 70% hydration would turn
out okay - not having significant oven spring.

My sourdough was too sour. The sourness in your your sourdough comes from
bacteria that produces lactic and acetic acid. This acid infuses the sour
taste to your dough. At the same time the acid improves shelf life of your
product, preventing mold from entering your dough. The reason why your dough
sticks together during fermentation is gluten. Gluten also traps the air
created by the fermentation in your your dough. A healthy strong gluten
network is the basis for baking a bread that has an open crumb and rises well
in your oven.

So my starter `Breadly Cooper` seemed to produce too much acid. I verified
this by buying a pH measuring device. My starter would have a pH before baking
of around 3.2. Whereas other peoples starter was less acidy. The acid impedes
the development of the gluten network. At some point the network is damaged.
Thus your bread then just turns into a sticky mess. I was shocked to learn
that my 2 year old sourdough might have reached its end of life. But that is
normal. You might at some point have added different bacteria. That bacteria
ferments faster and creates more acid. Overall your sourdough is a living
organism. You might want to try creating a new sourdough.

Another factor contributed to my lack of oven spring and dough flatness. I
would usually ferment my doughs over night, as the dough would not grow as
much as it did for others. Then after a couple of tests I realised a warmer
temperature is beneficial. Regardless, my sourdough would never double within
4 hours in size. So I had to increase my fermentation times. My dough became
much easier to work with after exchanging the starter. I could do stretch and
folds, my hands were not covered in dough after. However - after 8 hours of
fermentation or so the dough suddenly turned into a sticky mess again. I
observed similar issues when I fermented my dough over night. In the morning
the dough became so sticky. It was impossible to work the dough without adding
additional flour. When researching I saw people easily handing 80% hydration
dough. Something was way off. I improved my technique but still my dough was
more sticky. This seemed especially true for doughs that have high hydration.
Doughs with less hydration could easily ferment for longer periods.

I observed that over time dough seems to degrate. Conducting more research the
phenomenom is known by other bakers as `Gluten rot`. Since enzymes become
activated after water is added, the gluten is slowly transformed. Which makes
sense, since the seed needs sugars to grow. A similar process has been used
for thousands of years when brewing beer. You soak the grain in water. After a
few days the hull degrades. Some content of the grain transforms into
sugar which can be eaten by the endosperm.

This means you can not simply let your dough ferment for longer time
to compensate for lack of gas development by your starter. You have to maximise
fermentation speed in a short period of time. If you wait too long, tiny pockets
of air in your dough aka. alveoli collapse again. When taking to wine someliers
you learn that one of the qualities of wine comes from the yeast that ferments
the sugars. The yeast creates the unique taste of a wine. Some someliers
explained that a wine without might have 10 different taste notes, after
proper fermentation it multiplies. Back to baking bread, the fermentation
causes the unique taste of your loaf. Longer fermentation might create better
taste in your bread. It all seems to boil down to finding the perfect
combination of all the factors. On a site note - similarly to sourdough -
wine can also be fermented over a longer period of time, without adding
commercial yeast. Yeast naturally enters the crushed grapes and starts the
fermentation process. This technique however is way more difficult than
using commercial yeast, as the yeast might change from year to year. A somelier
has to pay close attention to the development of his product. For commercial
wines the whole process might not create significant good product from year to
year, thus most wineries utilise commercial yeast today.

All this talk about fermentation times, gluten degradation boils down to one
learning that you need to apply when baking. You need to make sure your
sourdough is super active, able to create the amount of gas that you need to inflate
the dough properly. My freshly created sourdough would need around 8 hours
to double in size at room temperature. I saw videos and guides where people
explained how their sourdough could triple in size in about 4 hours. I knew I
was onto something and started experimenting with the goal of making my
starter more active.

The quantity of yeast plus its activity in your sourdough is essential.
To make sure your yeast is as active as possible you need to feed it. This
means if you have your sourdough in your fridge, it can take up to 3 full days
to get it to its same activity levels again, before freezing it. I would only
bake on the weekends mostly. I took the sourdough from the fridge on Fridays,
then baked on Saturdays. This was way too little time for sourdough to become
super active again. Instead I would now take my sourdough with me whenever I
traveled. I would always have a small scale plus some flour with me as well.
By doing so I made sure my sourdough always had maximum activity.

Most guides suggest to create a sourdough starter over a week, then you can
use it to bake. This is true if you don't care that much
about dough degradation. A rye bread is a good example, there's almost no
gluten, you can not create an open crumb. You can just let the whole bread
ferment longer, not having any negative impact on the product. The opposite
happens, the bread develops more taste and has an increased shelf life.
However a freshly created sourdough needed way more time in my case. It
took me approx. 2 weeks to get my sourdough to a state where it was active
enough. It could triple in size after around 3 hours at 27°C room temperature.
Feeding your starter with rye can help, as rye naturally has more yeast
contamination. The added yeast expoententially increases in quantity rapidly.
The rye trick should only be applied during feeding cycles, not before the
actual bake. Rye in general impedes gluten development. Thus your crumb
will not turn out as open. I like to have a variety of different
yeast and bacteria in my sourdough. That's why I also feed my starter with
spelt, einkorn or emmer. It would be interesting to conduct further research
on sourdoughs from all around the world, which ones seem to be the most
active.

So lets get your sourdough nuclear. This guide assumes you already have a
sourdough starter. If not, you first need to make one. This is not part of
this guide.

For 4 days in a row you will do the following, twice per day:
1. Take 40 grams of sourdough
2. Feed it with 40 grams of full grain flour
3. Apply 40 grams of water.

The water should be around 20-28°C. It's important it is not too cold.
Temperature greatly impacts fermentation times.

Take a rubber band, or a pen to indicate the initial expansion of your dough.
This allows you to see how active your sourdough is. Place the container in a
warm environment in your house/flat. It shouldn't be too cold. In my case I
placed the dough in my bathroom where I constantly had around 22°C.

After 12 hours return to your sourdough and check whether it has expanded in
size. Take a new jar and repeat the same process with now **40 grams of
sourdough from the initial feeding**. This means your sourdough always has fresh
flour to feed on. You divide it into 1/3. This also has the advantage to leave
over fermented, too sour parts away. In the jar from the initial feeding you
should still have some sourdough left, probably around 75 grams, as you always
lose some product during fermentation. This old sourdough could be used to
bake a rye, emmer or einkorn bread - anything that does not need gluten
development. You could also make sourdough pancakes, sourdough crips,
sourdough pasta, or anything you please with it. Some bakers just discard that
sourdough. I like to store that highly fermented sourdough in an additional
jar in my fridge, ready for use whenever I please.

After 4 days your sourdough should be way more active than it was before. If
it is not, then you need to repeat this process. As suggested, eventually
switch to rye feeding for a day. My sourdough is able to rise to 3 times
its size within 4 hours. Baking a bread with an open crumb does not work
if your sourdough is not similarly active. I had to learn this the hard way.

I usually get up at 8 AM the day I want to bake. I had fed my sourdough in the
night at 10 PM. I won't use that starter to bake, instead I feed the sourdough
one more time in the morning. I place that sourdough starter in my oven with
lights on. That way I have around 27°C in the oven. After 4 hours the sourdough
has tripled in size. If it does - you are ready to go. You have the rock solid
basis to bake an amazing bread.

## Autolyse

Take the large pot and place it on your scale.

* Add 320 grams of all purpose wheat flour
* Add 80 grams of full grain wehat flour
* Add 320 grams of water at 23°C. This means you have 80% hydration.
* If you have 2 banetons, you can also double all the quantities and make two
  breads. During the preshape phase, the dough is splitted into 2 pieces.
  This allows you to A/B the last stages of the baking process.

Stir all the ingredients together with your hand for around 2 minutes. Just
move your hand around in circles, until everyhting has been nicely mixed
together. Make sure there are no chunks of flour left at the bottom of the
pot. The dough will look like a sticky mess. This step is to have the
flour absorb the water. Furthermore the atoms will
homogenize and spread evenly throughout the dough. This will already
give you basic gluten structures.

Cover the pot with the lid, you do not want the contents to dry out. If you
use a bowl, you can instead cover the bowl with plastic wrap.

## Add sourdough

After 2 hours we will be adding our sourdough starter. It must have tripled in
size since you created it initially. Take out 80 grams of your sourdough
starter and place it in the same bowl. That's 20% starter. Overall our bread
has a final hydration of 81.8% (360 grams of water with 440 grams of flour)

Incorporate the sourdough with your hands. If you pull parts of the dough
where no starter has been added, you will notice how well the dough already
sticks together. This is the basis for a good bread, your autolyse was
successfull.

## Rubaud kneading #1

Please note that kneading times depend on the flour that you are using. The
numbers in this guide have shown the best results for my setup. The only way
to find out for yourself is to A/B test. Try alternating kneading times
between doughs that you make.

Set a timer for around 8 minutes and start kneading your bread using the
rubaud method. This inflates your dough with basic gas. At the same time it
creates a lot of strength in your dough. Strength is equal to a strong gluten
network. This allows your dough to stay in shape and not turn out flat in
later stages.

The process is best explained in this video. Basically you form your hand into
a shovel and dig in below the dough. Take the hand back out, stretching the
dough. By each digging in you add air. By each stretch you create additional
strength. Rotate the dough from time to time. You will notice that the dough
becomes less sticky. The dough stretches more nicely and does not fall apart.
The more you do this, the more this becomes visible.

I suggest to do this by hand because you develop a dough conscience. With
every dough you make, you will feel whether it is ready or not. As kneading
times differ from flour to flour, developing an understanding is important.
This allows you to adapt with different parameter changes.

To finish the process, stretch and fold the dough on top of each other. Don't
worry, you likely have some dough stuck to your hands. Just use some water to
wash the dough off.

## Add salt

Salt has a negative influence on both gluten network and fermentation times.
The yeast and bacteria works slower with salt added. That's why we add the
salt after the initial rubaud kneading. We will be adding 8 grams of salt,
equaling 2% of the flour mass.

## Rubaud kneading #2

Repeat the same process as you did initially for another 8 minutes. Your dough
should stick together way more now. It will naturally turn back and resist you
with every stretch that you do.

Wait for 15 minutes before proceeding with the next step. This allows the
dough to relax a little and become shapable easier.

## Lamination

Only recently I learned about lamination and like to add that to every bread
that I bake now. It adds additional strength to your dough. The dough is
spread apart, then folded back on top of each other. Because it is sticky, it
will stick to itself. Because of the folds, it will stick to itself on
multiple layers. This creates lots of strength. Some people even skip the
rubaud kneading and just use lamination. My tests have shown that a
combination of both creates a superb amount of strength. Only with that
level of dough strength my loafs would not flatten out in the oven. They would
expand nicely and create beautiful looking ears during the bake. Exactly what
I wanted.

Wet the work bench in front of you and place your dough on the bench from the
container. Do one more stretch and fold before taking the dough out of the
container. Take the dough out with a swift move, to not tear it too much.
Wet your hands again and carefully pull the dough apart in a rectangular shape.
It should look like a large rectangular pizza in front of you. The thickness
of the dough should be even in that rectangular shape. Make sure your dough
does not pull apart by tearing it too much apart. Be very gentle. Once the
dough starts sticking too much to your hands, wet them again.

Note that your dough now very likely sticks to the surface slightly. With
wetted hands, or your dough scraper to gently lift 1/6th of the dough upwards
and fold it over the next 1/6th. Repeat this process until you have a long
piece of dough. Now start folding that large piece of dough on top of each
other again until you have a small rectangular piece of dough in front of you.
The dough should stay in its shape and not flatten out. This is because
internally the layers of dough now nicely stick to each other. You developed a
lot of strength. This part is fundamental for all the following steps.
