# Simple Bread Recipe

This bread will be a really simple bread you can do at home. The goal for me was to use only the tools everyone has available at home. So no tools needed except a bowl.

You need a flower with high protein. The more protein the more gluten. The stickier the dough becomes, the better the crust becomes. It's win win, get high protein. In Germany it's the flour type 550, but in the US all purpose flour. Look at the options and pick the one with highest protein. The one I used has around 12 gram of protein per 100 grams.

## Prepare the ingredients

In the bowl mix:

* 500 grams flour
* 375 ml of water (75% of the flour)
* 10 grams of salt (2% of the flour)

Mix it with a spoon or your hands. If you use your hands, make them wet a little so it doesn't stick too much. Just swirl it.

Let it rest for 1 hour.

## Adding yeast

After the hour passed add the yeast to the dough. I use a pack of dry yeast, 7 grams. I didn't see major improvements on fresh yeast. I usually have a pack of dry yeast somewhere.

Mix it all together. Make your hands a little wet. Also this is the time to add more ingredients which you find yummy. You can add nuts, seeds, salami, dates whatever you want here. Although I suggest to initially only start with the basic bread no additional ingredients. Once you mastered that, move on. Ceteris Paribus, only change one variable at the time.

You should already notice by then that the dough become a lot sticker than initially. The gluten naturally formed. The gluten naturally diffused and formed a layer already. We need to strengthen that layer now. We want a grid to be formed which traps all the air inside of the dough. The more you knead the more the gluten develops. It's not possible to over-knead the dough. I suggest around 10 minutes. There is no special kneading technique. Just put force on the dough.

Now stretch and folding starts. Basically just stretch the dough as much as you can. Then fold it back on top again. That way the gluten grid nicely forms. A good way to test your gluten: Pull the dough on one side in the air. It should the spread apart slowly in the air. Master this step, if this is done well, 90% of your bread is nicely baked. In my case this state usually arrives after another 10 minutes or so. To avoid the dough stiking to ecoming sticky. Don't be afraid of adding a little more water to the dough by wetting your hands. Some recipes go up to 100% of water per 100 grams flour.

In that picture I used full grain flour for another dough. But the principle is the same.

To get some background on this I suggest this video: [https://youtu.be/zDEcvSc2UKA?t=2m18s](https://youtu.be/zDEcvSc2UKA?t=2m18s)

## Wait 8 hours

After 8 hours wet your hands again. Stretch and fold one more time. The dough will collapse a lot. Don't worry. I usually do this in the morning after getting up.

## Wait Another 10 hours at least

The longer you wait the better. I do this usually once I return from work. The moment I return I do another stretch and fold, the last time.

## Shape the dough

Directly after your last stretch&fold start shaping the dough.

Prepare a container into which you will put your final dough. Either you have a proofing basked, but you can also use a cooking pot. Flour it nicely on the edges. If it won't stick, use baking paper which you also flour a little. This is where we will let the dough rest for another hour.

* Put some flour on the table
* Wetten your hands again with cold water.
* Put your dough on the floured table
* Put the edges on top of each other
* Repeat until a nice ball formed
* Rounden it up a little
* Be gentle on the dough, at this stage we don't want air to escape the dough
* Put the dough into the container you prepared earlier. Upside down. So the nice round top is actually facing the bottom of the container.

For more details this video by Jack is quite useful: [https://youtu.be/ww78_SfGyQE](https://youtu.be/ww78_SfGyQE). This was the most difficult step for me. It took me at least 20 attempts to get it right. Don't worry if you don't succeed here yet. You will at some point. The bread will still taste very nice. Also the dough Jack prepares in the video has a little less water. So it's more easy for him to shape it.

This is how my bread 75% hydration bread typically looks like before letting it rest for another hour.

## Preheat the oven to max temperature

After 30 minutes of shaping the dough, preheat the oven to max temperature. In my case that's around 270 degrees. Place a tray in the oven. At the bottom of the oven play another tray of water. We are using the water because it creates steam. The steam supports the dough and allows it to rise it more in the oven.

## Finally bake the bread

After another 30 minutes of the oven pre-heating, remove the top tray and place your bread directly on the tray. Careful, this is super hot. Cut the bread with 2 cm deep cuts at an angle. Imagine this like tectonic plates. It creates a weakness in the surface and allows the bread to raise at the point of weakness. If the cut is vertical the bread will block it self.

This is another bread I made, but the principle remains the same. Cut it with a sharp knife. Feel free and be creative.

Put the bread into the oven. Wait for 25 minutes.

## Remove the tray with water

After the 25 minutes remove the tray of water. The reason being we want the bread crust to become super crisp now. The bread no longer rises at this point. The yeast has been killed, the water evaporated. We use this time to really get it crispy.

After another 20 minutes in the oven your bread is ready to be enjoyed.
