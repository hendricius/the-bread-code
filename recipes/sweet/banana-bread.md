# Banana Bread

This is more like a cake than a bread. It is a soft bread that is still moist inside. You usually eat it by itself.

## Ingredients

- 2-3 soft bananas
- 150g sugar
- 125g butter
- 5ml vanilla extract
- 2 beaten eggs
- 1 table spoon yogurt 
- 250 g wheat flour 
- 1/2 teaspoons of salt
- 1 teaspoons bicarbonate soda

### Additional Information

- The Bananas should be very soft to get a decent taste.
- If they are dark brown from the outside (mostly brown inside) to get the best taste and you can reduce the sugar a bit.
- You can freeze brown bananas and use them later for the bread, but you get a more dense bread out of it.
- You can exchange the vanilla extract with a small package / 2 table spoons of vanilla sugar.
- You can exchange the bicarbonate soda with backing powder (if you like it fluffy and don't like the taste of the soda)

## Instructions

Squash the bananas, and mix it with the sugar, butter, vanilla extract, the eggs and the yogurt until it is frothy. Mix the flour with the salt and the bicarbonate soda separately and mix now everything together until it is a uniform mass.

Fill the mass in a 20 cm tin loaf.

Bake it at 150 C with air circulation for one hour.

## Variations

### Fluffy Variation

Use 2 or 3 teaspoons of bicarbonate soda to get a fluffy texture.

### Lactose Free Variation

Leave the yogurt, and change butter with margarine or oil. The texture is almost the same.

### Vegan Variation

Leave the yogurt, the eggs, and change butter with margarine or oil. The texture isn't fluffy. Might help to add more bicarbonate soda, but didn't tried it yet.
