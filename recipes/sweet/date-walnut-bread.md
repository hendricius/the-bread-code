# Date Walnut Bread

The date walnut bread is an exquisite bread with an amazing taste. 
You initially taste the dates and then have walnutty taste afterwards.
I never put any toppings on the bread as it tastes great on its own.

## Custom Ingredients

- 100 grams of walnuts
- 100 grams of dates

### Recipe customization

Cut the dates and walnuts into small pieces. I like to put the walnuts into a plastic bag and crush them with a hammer. Place the ingredients on the dough in front of you.
