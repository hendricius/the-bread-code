# Date Walnut Bread

The date walnut bread is an exquisit bread with an amazing taste. You initially taste the dates and then have walnutty taste afterwards. I never put any toppings on the bread as it tastes very well standalone.

## Custom Ingredients

- 100 grams of walnuts
- 100 grams of dates

### Recipe customization

Cut the dates and walnuts into small pieces. I like to put the walnuts into a plastic bag. Then I use a hammer to crush them. Place the ingredients on the dough in front of you.
