# Tools

The goal of this small quide is to clarify what kind of tools you need for baking your bread.

I want to start by saying that `10_000` years ago there were no tools available for baking a bread. Be very careful when people tell you to buy a specific tool. However with advances in technology there are a few gadgets that make it easier for you to bake bread. If you have no tools, don't be afraid, you can get started anyways.

## Bowl (required)

You should have a nice bowl in which you can prepare your bread. This can be made out of glass, metal or plastic. The bigger the better as it will be easier for you to work the dough in a larger bowl. It's advisable to have two of the bowels. The first bowl you will need to prepare and mix the dough. Before putting the dough in the oven you shape the dough and let it rest. A clean bowl then with some parchment paper is ideal. If you have a baneton you don't need the second bowl.

## Oven (required)

Instead of an oven you can also use a barbecue or a fire. However a oven is practical and easy to control. The max temperature you need is around 230 degrees celsius. So having an oven that goes up to 250 degrees is ideal.

## Baking tray (required)

Some kind of plate on which you can put the dough or any other container in your oven. In case you have no pizza stone or dutch oven it's advisable to cover it with parchment paper so your dough will not stick to it.

## Baneton (optional)

A baneton is used to let your dough rise one last time before baking it. Instead of using one bowl with parchment paper I prefer the baneton. Reason being I don't need to buy parchment paper. Also to me it feels more natural to just let the dough rise in a wooden baneton. Additionally a baneton powered bread I believe looks visually a little more appealing. You have nice circles of flour on the top of your bread.

## Metal / glas tray (optional)

Some kind of container which is able to endure high heats is ideal. In case you have a dutch oven you will not need this. The tray will be used to create additional steam inside of your oven. Before baking you put water inside of the tray and let it cook. The steam supports the bread while rising as the crust does not get crispy that fast.


## Dutch oven (optional)

Although the dutch oven is optional I highly recommend it. You can also re-create your own dutch oven with a pizza stone and a large lid. Basically all you need is some kind of device that fully covers your bread in the oven. The reason being that the water that exits your dough will stay trapped in the dutch oven. That way it's like some kind of dough sauna. The dough remains wet and can rise more in the oven. The crust does not get too crispy instantly, supporting the rise of the dough. The result is a fluffier bread with more air bubbles. Furthermore the dutch oven is a good source of heat making sure that the bread cooks evenly from all sides.

When using the dutch oven you also no longer need parchment paper at all. The bread dough is inserted into the dutch oven without the parchment paper.

## Pizza stone (optional)

A pizza stone is nice as it can store a lot of heat. The moment your bread dough gets into contact with the stone a lot of energy is released directly to the dough. This creates a yummy beautiful crust.
