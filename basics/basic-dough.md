# The Basic Dough

Use this basic dough recipe as starter for all your upcoming breads. Custom
ingredients are added before the final shaping. The basic formula always
remains the same.

Prepare the dough always 24 hours before baking. If you run out of time you can also do this faster but then have to knead more initially. In this case a kitchen air or a similar tool can be helpful as it will speed up the process.

## Ingredients

- 500 grams of all-purpose flour (high protein). In Germany type 550.
- 375 grams of water or 75%. Experiment with more hydration as well.
- 10 grams of salt or 2%
- 5 grams of dry yeast or 1%

## Instructions

### Preparation steps

The default recipe does not require any steps to be taken in advance. Custom recipes hook in here with additional steps that are required to be done before starting the bake.

### Autolyse

Mix together all the ingredients in a large bowl except the yeast. Stir them with a spoon for 2 minutes. Let the dough rest for an hour after this step to have the flour absorb the water. Furthermore the atoms will homogenize and spread evenly throughout the dough.

### Add the yeast

Place the yeast evenly on top of your dough. Many sources claim this should be done after the autolysing. However when baking myself I sometimes added yeast right away. I could not notice a significant difference. It would be interesting to conduct more research on this topic.

### Form the gluten

We need a really strong layer of gluten to trap the air in the dough. At the same time this will make the bread more crispy. Bread with nicely formed gluten will not fall apart when cutting.

Knead the dough for around 5 minutes. This will also evenly distribute the yeast we previously added. There is no special technique, just imagine you want to punch the dough. If the dough sticks too much to your hands, wet them in water. Test whether your gluten is nicely formed or not by lifting the dough in the air with one hand. The dough should slowly flow back to the bowl.

If it starts sticking together you have your gluten. Experiment on this step further in the future to form really strong gluten connections.

Cover the dough with some foil or linen for 8 hours. I usually go to bed and resume the next morning

### Stretch and Fold Part 1

After 8 hours we will now start stretching and folding the dough. Don't worry if the dough will collapse after the 8 hours. The yeast will start its work again after this step.

The idea is to increase the strength of the gluten network even further. Don't knead the dough too hard at this point. Be soft and gentle.

To stretch and fold wet your hands and start pulling the dough upwards at one area of the bowl. I start at the bottom and stretch it all the way to the top. Assuming your bowl is northwards in front of you, you are standing south of the bowl, take the north part of the dough and place it on the south part of the dough. Rotate the bowl by 90° and do the same. Do this in circles. I tested different quantities of rotation but made the best experience with 4x360° degree rotations. As mentioned before be soft and gentle at this point.

### Stretch and Fold Part 2

After another 10 hours (after work) do the same step again you did before. We will want to stretch and fold the dough one more time. If you are at home you can also stretch and fold the dough more often with at least 1 hour intervals.

### Shaping the dough

Directly after the last stretch and fold remove the dough from the tray and place it on a lightly floured surface. Don't be scared of adding a little more flour at the start. That way your dough won't stick that much. On the long term reduce the flour you use at this step. The more hydrated your dough, the more fluffy it will become in the oven.

Stretch the dough apart a little to form some kind of pizza. Then move the outer parts of the pizza in wards to the center. Piece by piece your dough will become rounder.

### Recipe customization

At this place most of the other recipes hook in. Once the dough is in front of you, you can start adding ingredients such as cheese, spinach, walnuts or whatever you want. For starting, I suggest to not go with too many extras.

### Finalizing the shaping

![Sample bread with goat cheese. This is the time to add it](https://i.imgur.com/U55wUEk.jpg)

The trickiest part of the process now starts. You want the bottom part of the dough that you just created to face you upwards. Because that one is nice and around. Rotate the dough so the lower part is not facing you directly.

Gently stretch the edges of the dough a little bit downwards. I use my hands to do that on the above pic. The goal is to create more tension on the surface. This will support the dough in the oven and make it raise more upwards. If your bread is too flat, this is very likely the step that you need to improve.

### Place the dough in a clean bowl

If you have a [banneton](tools.md#banneton-optional) use a banneton. If not use a clean bowl. Place the shaped dough upside down in the container. The round surface that you created should be now at the bottom of your banneton or bowl. When baking the dough we will rotate the bowl and the round surface will again be on top in the oven. Cover the bowl with linen or some foil.

Let the dough rest for an hour, or over the night in the fridge.

### Preheat the oven to max temperature

After 30 minutes of shaping the dough, preheat the oven to max temperature. In my case that's around 270 degrees. It also takes another 30 degrees for the oven to reach max temperature. Place a tray in the oven. At the bottom of the oven play another tray of water. We are using the water because it creates steam. The steam supports the dough and allows it to rise it more in the oven.

### Finally bake the bread

After another 30 minutes of the oven preheating, remove the top tray and place your bread directly inside (Caution: It is super hot). If you have a dutch oven, place the bread in the dutch oven. Cut the bread with 2 cm deep cuts at an angle. Imagine tectonic plates: the cuts create a weakness in the surface (a point from which the bread is allowed to rise). If the cut is vertical the bread will block it. In comparison, if cut at an angle you can create the bread Himalayan mountains 😻.

Put the bread into the oven. Reduce the temperature to 230 degrees. Wait for 25 minutes.

### Remove (the tray with water or lid)

![The bread should have grown nicely by now](https://i.imgur.com/tfMzyaH.jpg)

After the 25 minutes remove the tray of water or the lid of the dutch oven. The reason being we want the bread crust to become super crisp now. The bread no longer rises at this point. The yeast has been killed, the water evaporated. We use this time to really get it crispy.

After another 20 minutes in the oven your bread is ready to be enjoyed.
