# Common Problems (FAQ)

This is a list of frequent questions/problems together with possible solutions how to react.
Since very dough and every oven is different there is no perfect recipe.
You will need to experiment and learn. You will face a couple of pitfalls and then double check with this list.
Make sure that you always only change 1 parameter at the same time.
That way you can iterate and learn how each parameter influences the final product.

#### There is liquid gathering on top of my sourdough starter when making it
That is no problem. This happens. Yeast and bacteria like a moist surrounding.
With initial higher hydration the yeast and bacteria can homogenise nicer throughout
the dough that you are making.
Since you are making the starter without any cover for the first days, this is totally fine.
Just make sure to nicely stir the flour and water the next time you feed the starter.
We are adding equal amounts of water and flour on all the subsequent days.
That way our initial 200% hydration will slowly decrease.
At the same time the dough will dry out a little bit, further decreasing hydration.
Ultimately you should aim for around 50% hydration in your sourdough starter.

#### When making the starter parts in the bowl dry out
Don't worry. Just keep stirring. Every part of the dough, even if it is dry already contains
more yeast and bacteria. Just keep going it until your starter is ready.
The bowl might look like a mess, but that is fine

#### My sourdough already looks ready after 4 days
That can happen. It might be that there is more yeast and bacteria in your surrounding.
You might also have stored the bowl in a warmer environment, providing a better way
for the bacteria and yeast to grow. Try the starter, it should taste really sour.
If it only tastes lightly sour then keep going. If the starter passes your taste test
you can also simply start baking your first bread. For that extract some parts of
your mother dough and proceed with your recipe.
In this case you can directly take the mother dough and mix it with the flour.
Normally you always want to feed your mother dough before using it for the bake.
However in this case as you should have significant amounts of mother dough,
taking 100 grams should not be an issue.

#### What is the best ratio of sour dough and flour when baking?
When I do sourdough I usually take 40% sourdough. In case I would use 100 grams
of flour I would add 40 grams of sour dough. The more sour dough you add, the more sour your bread becomes.
At the same time you will have more yeast releasing gas. That means your bread
will become fluffier with more sour dough. Some people like their bread a little
sourer than others. You also need to consider for how long you will the dough rest
before baking. In that time the yeast/bacteria will feast on the flour, releasing the
gas as well as the lactic acids. I suggest to play with the 40%, do a couple of A/B tests to see
which percentage you prefer.

#### How long does it take to feed the mother dough before baking?
Let's say it's Friday and you want to bake a bread on Saturday. A good amount of flour
for a regular sourdough bake is around 400 grams. That will give you a really nice loaf.
We aim for a 40% sourdough flour mixture. Which means we will need 160 grams of sour dough
inside of our dough. Take out a large bowl and mix 100 grams of your mother dough with 50
grams of water and flour. That way you have 200 grams of sourdough.

#### When feeding the dough, what temperature should the water have?

#### After a few weeks of not feeding, liquid started to appear on top of the mother dough

#### In which temperature should I store the mother dough?

#### I have a wheat starter but want to make a rye bread

#### I have a rye stater and want to make a wheat bread

#### What is the best temperature to bake the bread?

#### My bread does not rise properly in the oven

#### The interior of my yeast bread is somewhat hard and not fluffy

#### My sourdough bread dough does not increase in size after a few hours

#### The crust is too thick on my bread

#### My crust is too little on my bread

#### When shaping the dough the dough always sticks to my hands

#### When shaping the dough the dough sticks on the surface

#### Guests are arriving in 2 hours and I want to offer a bread

#### My bread looks like a pancake in the oven

#### I forgot to measure the times when is my bread ready?

The moment the crust is turning nice and brown. If you cut the bread which you should've done then some edges of the crust can be a little black. There is still debate going on whether acrylamides are dangerous for humans or not. `TODO` - add some sources.

#### I forgot to add salt to the dough - what now?

#### What is a good ratio of salt in the bread?

#### How important is kneading?

#### How long should I wait before the actual bake?

#### Why are there expensive bread baking machines if this guide suggest to do all manually?

#### My bread does not have any nice air bubbles inside. How can I achieve that?

#### What is the ideal hydration for the bake?
