# Result

Both of the breads were quite similar when baking. The doughs felt very
sticky, almost like a rye dough. The emmer crumb looks a lot like a rye crumb.
The Einkorn crumb has a distinct yellowish color.

Taste wise both of them had a distinct rich taste. They were in the middle of
wheat and rye. Rye has a stronger taste. It felt like a really smooth
experience.

There is no winner here, both of them are equally great.
