# Scoring at vertically vs at an angle

Test how the raise in the oven of the bread changes if you score it at an
angle versus vertically.

Scored at an angle with X vs scored vertically with a X.

# Bread 1

I baked a sourdough bread following the [standard sourdough recipe.](../recipes/sourdough/standard-sourdough-bread.md)

When scoring the bread I cut the bread vertically with a large X.

# Bread 2

Same ingredients as bread 1.

When scoring the bread I cut the bread at an angle with a large X.

# Result

The vertical scored bread did have less oven rise. Taste wise they were the
same. The crumb was the same on both breads. The difference being that the
angled bread was a little higher. The bread that was cut vertically looked a
little bit like a flat pancake.

The winner is the bread scored at an angle.
